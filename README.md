## Abstract
The need for interpreting machine learning models is addressed through prototype explanations within the context of tree ensembles.
An algorithm named Adaptive Prototype Explanations of Tree Ensembles (A-PETE) is proposed to automatise the selection of prototypes
for these classifiers. Its unique characteristics is using a specialised distance measure and a modified k-medoid approach. Experiments
demonstrated its competitive predictive accuracy with respect to earlier explanation algorithms. It also provides a a sufficient number of
prototypes for the purpose of interpreting the random forest classifier.
